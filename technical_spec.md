5. **Splash Screen**  
    1. `Handler`  
    To set wait time by use Handler class to create a thread to wait for amount of time. Usually splash screen is use to load up stuff for the app. The wait time can be longer, usually have a nice background logo image or text displaying.
    Splash screen will replace signin page if user already signin, display only for 1 second.  

6. **Sign up / Sign in / skip page**  
    1. Use TabHost class to create 2 tabs to select between Sign in or Sign up TabActivity.  
    2. Create 2 layouts Sign in / Sign up.  
        1. Use 4 EditText and a Button to insert new data to parse.com database, "Users" table, "username, password, email" fields.  
        2. Use 2 EditText and a Button to match query data from parse.com database, "Users" table, "username, password". See parse.com API to find out how to do it.  
    3. A Button without border looks like just text to go to Home page, with out Sign up or Sign in.

7. **Home Page**  
    1. `ListView with custom view for each item`  
    The home page will show quotes by android class ListVeiw, order by popularity of paste 24 hr. By customize the view instead of using the build-in view for each list item, we can add image to each list item and format the displaying text. The build in view only allow text.

    2. `EndlessScrollListener`  
    When user scroll down, more quote will show up until the last quote, this is done by EndlessScrollListener. It request more item if over the threshold of remaining item before the end of current page. It is more useful for loading huge amount of data or data size will keep on growing by the second; which only load a small amount at a time not all at once to your device, so the wait time will be cut into section, or not overflow your View class capacity. First download a already  make EndlessScrollListener.java, find one that come with documentation that tell you how to use it. Some useful parameter or variable for your app to use or pass in; EX: "page" load more base on fix number of item consider one page, "totalItemsCount" load more base on number of item reached, "visibleThreshold" start load more base on how many items left before reach the end of current page. ![alt text](http://hills.ccsf.edu/~yliu192/cs177/p11_endlessscrolllistener.png)  
    3. `navigation drawer`  
    User can bring out the overflow menu by press the ActionBar icon on the upper left, or the icon on the upper right, or slide a finger from left edge of screen by using ActionBarDrawerToggle, DrawerLayout, ListView, and android.support.v4.widget.DrawerLayout. Developer can just use a Menu instead of navigation drawer to do the same thing.

The search is an "logical AND" search, all key words have to be in the same quote, in any location. It search all the quotes query from the online database parse.com. The "magnifying glass" use to expand to search field. The "X" icon is both use to clear the search field and to contract back to icon.
